# WIP: pipelineshell (plsh)

A functional-like shell with a focus on using pipes, lambdas and functions to accomplish needs. 

**Note:** This started as an attempt to build a fully functional shell with pipes, assignments and commands in 24h at a local hackathon. After that attempt it only half lived up to the original idea, but I'm now attempting to make it a real thing with lambdas and functions (Last updated Oct 16th).
